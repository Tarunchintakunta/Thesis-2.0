"""Raw evidence -> dependent variables.

The simulator and the live collector both call ``compute_run_metrics`` so the
maths is exactly the same in both modes. Definitions follow the 
(section 4.4):

* loss rate        = (produced - |processed unique  U  DLQ unique|) / produced
* duplicate rate   = extra successful process events per unique processed msg
* DLQ capture rate = unique messages in DLQ / produced
* success rate     = unique successful business writes / produced
* recovery time    = fault OFF -> queue depth back inside the pre-fault band
* throughput       = unique successes / wall time
* latency          = produce -> first successful process (p50 / p95)

Loss is measured at the end of the observation horizon, so anything still
sitting in the main queue at that point counts as not accounted for. That part
is also reported on its own as ``stranded_rate`` so it is not hidden.
